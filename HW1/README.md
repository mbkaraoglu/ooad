This ShapeCollection.java program is a simple program that creates three shapes of different colors and sizes 
(Triangle, Circle, and Square, all of which inherit from the Shape abstract class), sorts them based on their area 
with the help of the Comparable interface, and "displays" all of them. To run this code, you will need a JDK (Java Development Kit).

After obtaining a JDK, you can first compile the code in a terminal by doing:

`javac ShapeCollection.java`

And then execute the compiled byte code by doing:

`java ShapeCollection`
