This ShapeCollection.java program is a simple program that creates three shapes of different colors and sizes 
(Triangle, Circle, and Square, all of which inherit from the Shape abstract class), sorts them based on their area 
with the help of the Comparable interface, and "displays" all of them. To run this code, you will need a JDK (Java Development Kit).

You can first compile it by doing: 
`javac` ShapeCollection.java
